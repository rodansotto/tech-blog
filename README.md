To build the site and make it available on a local server:

```
    bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Pass the `--livereload` option to serve to automatically refresh the page with each change you make to the source files:

```
    bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

Then browse to http://localhost:4000

To preview your site with drafts, run `jekyll serve` or `jekyll build` with the `--drafts` switch
