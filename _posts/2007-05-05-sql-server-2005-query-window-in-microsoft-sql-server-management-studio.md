The query window has  a lot more to offer than just outputting the results to grid.  You can also output the results in text format and also save the results to a file.  If you are in the query window, you may notice an additional toolbar on top of it similar to the one below:

There are 3 buttons there that let you specify how you want your output from the query.  They are **Results to Text**, **Results to Grid**, and **Results to File** respectively:
