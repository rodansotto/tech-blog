Before going into design patterns, one must need to know the four OO basics:

- **Abstraction** is showing only the necessary details to the outside world. It is the abstract form of anything. It is implemented using [interface](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/87d83y5b(v=vs.110).aspx) and [abstract class](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/sf985hc5(v=vs.110).aspx).

- **Encapsulation** is hiding the details from the outside world. It is the opposite of abstraction. It is implemented using private and protected [access modifiers](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/ms173121(v=vs.110).aspx) inside a class.

- **Polymorphism**, as itâ€™s name suggests, means many shapes. In OOP it is providing a single interface to entities of different types. It is implemented in C# as [abstract classes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/sf985hc5(v=vs.110).aspx) and [virtual functions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9fkccyh4(v=vs.110).aspx). See [Polymorphism in C#](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/csharp_polymorphism.htm).

- **Inheritance** is a way for an entity to inherit the characteristics of another entity, thus establishing a parent-child relationship, or in a more technical OO term, an IS-A relationship. It is implemented using base and derived classes.
