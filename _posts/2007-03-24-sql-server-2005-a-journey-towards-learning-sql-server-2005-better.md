I have worked on Access database for a long time now and recently worked on [SQL Server 2005 Express.](http://www.microsoft.com/sql/editions/express/default.mspx)  I did some SQL Server stored procedures and triggers before that but it has been a while.  So now I told myself why not learn more about it and post my new found knowledge on a blog site and so this came about.  I just got a book by [Robert Vieira](http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/productCd-0764584332,descCd-authorInfo.html) titled **[Beginning SQL Server 2005 Programming](http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/productCd-0764584332.html)** to help me with my journey and hopefully using this blog will inspire me to continue reading and learning [SQL Server 2005](http://www.microsoft.com/sql/default.mspx).  So let's begin!
