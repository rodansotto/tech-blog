![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/aibloglogo.png) Recently got interested in AI, particularly how far it has gone.  Now I'm wondering if we are close to having the ultimate AI that closely resembles a human being.  I have some background on AI (well sort of) during my university days a long time ago :).  I did work on a thesis on fingerprint recognition that requires advanced math skills (e.g. Fourier transforms, etc.)

 but good thing there is already an IBM PC that time to do that for you.  I also met someone doing his Masters thesis using neural networks to train a computer to just check a multiple choice exam.  If I remember it right, he is using the back propagation algorithm.  Don't quote me on these, I never did try to understand all these stuff at that time, plus it's actually advance to me.  Fast forward today I see there are already a bunch of algorithms that were created and different ways to train an AI and I would be interested to check them out and see for myself if I can create my own AI that I can train from baby stage to adult stage.  I have this opinion that it will take years to train an AI just like how we humans learn.  I think in an AI, there are many different areas that a machine learning need to be applied.  Ultimately, an AI needs to learn how to learn all these stuff.

So I started this post just to compile my findings on the latest technologies / tools related to AI.  So far here are some of them and I will continue to update this as I discover more.

- A [cheat sheet](https://becominghuman.ai/cheat-sheets-for-ai-neural-networks-machine-learning-deep-learning-big-data-678c51b4b463) listing all there is right now in AI, Neural Networks, Machine Learning, Deep Learning & Big Data.  It will give you an idea on what has been done or currently being done.
- A [program in Python](http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/) implementing neural networks.  Mind you this is really very technical and requires time to understand.  I noticed that Python seems to be the language of choice for machine learning, but I only stumbled upon a few.  Have to dig in some more.
- There is also [Microsoft Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning-studio/) which would be interesting to check too.
