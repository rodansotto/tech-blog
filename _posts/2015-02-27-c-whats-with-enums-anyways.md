![c#snow1](https://rodansotto.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/csnow1.jpg?w=300)Well, I’ll tell you.  You can define your own strings with Enums using **reflection**.  You can also use the **type-safe-enum pattern** if reflection seems slow to you.  And do you know you can use Enums to represent **bit flags**?

[Associating Enums with strings in C#](http://www.yumeidearmas.com/2015/02/26/associating-enums-with-strings-in-c/) shows you how to define your own strings with Enums using reflection.  For type-safe-enum pattern implementation, check it out [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/424366/c-sharp-string-enums).  [The ins and outs of C# enums](http://www.codeducky.org/ins-outs-c-enums/) shows you how to use Enums to represent bit flags.
