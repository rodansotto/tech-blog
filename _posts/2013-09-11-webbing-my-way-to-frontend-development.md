I just joined the [Front End Developer Group](http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Front-End-Developer-Group-2231152?trk=my_groups-b-grp-v) in LinkedIn and came across this posting with a link to a [site](http://fredsarmento.me/frontend-tools/#!) listing the best front end tools and resources.  And I say it really is one heck of a list.  For me just beginning to work my way to frontend development, this is really useful.  What actually caught my attention are the list of sites that offer free tutorials, and here they are:

- [Codeacademy](http://www.codecademy.com/)
- [Code School](http://www.codeschool.com/)
- [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/)
- [Lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com/)
- [Tuts+](https://tutsplus.com/)

I am so excited now in this journey of mine to learn more about frontend development, because I consider myself to be more middle-tier/backend developer.  I think it is time I get myself into it to bring out my creativity I guess.  Wish me luck!
