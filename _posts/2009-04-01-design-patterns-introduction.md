I will be writing about design patterns.Â  I believe design patterns should be part of your development tool as they provide you solutions to common problems that have been encountered by other developers before you.

I will start with the most common design patterns such as: **Mediator**, **Adapter**, **Proxy**, **Observer**, **Strategy**, **Decorator**, **Factory**, **Observer**, **Chain of Responsibility**, **Singleton**, **Flyweight**, **Facade**, **Template Method**, **Builder**, **Iterator**, **Composite**, **State**, and **Command** patterns.
