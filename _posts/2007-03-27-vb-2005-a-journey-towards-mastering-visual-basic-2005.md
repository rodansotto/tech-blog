My last project involved using [Visual Basic 2005](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vbasic/default.aspx).  This is the latest version of VB.NET.  I have used Visual Basic before starting with version 4.0.  In fact I got certified a long time ago, **November 2001** to be exact, as a [**Microsoft Certified Professional (MCP)**](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcp/default.mspx) by passing the exam [Designing and Implementing Desktop Applications with Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-176.mspx).  Now that I am using VB 2005, it's time for me to master this technology and hopefully get back on track with my certification.  I recently bought a book titled **[Professional VB 2005](http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/productCd-0764575368.html)** by various authors and I will be reading this book to help me with my journey and of course this blog will serve as my notes pad.  So here we go!
