I haven't made a post for almost 5 years now since I took this job which I'm still at right now.  I'm going 5 years in this job pretty soon.  Part of the reason is of course the pandemic.  The other is it just kept me busy and kept me learning... and I learned a lot.  But what's with the title then?  I thought of posting this on LinkedIn and see if that title catches attention.

Anyways, that aside, I just wanted to share that I put up my web site again (as it was down for while now) and this time hosted on GitHub at [rodansotto.github.io](https://rodansotto.github.io).  I thought it makes sense for my web site which features coding projects I did in my spare time, to live besides their source code.  Yes I have uploaded my source code to GitHub and this will be my code repository moving forward.  You can see my repositories at [github.com/rodansotto](https://github.com/rodansotto).  Also, I migrated my technical blog from WordPress to GitHub and it's now at [rodansotto.github.io/tech-blog](https://rodansotto.github.io/tech-blog).  So if you are reading this now, then you are reading this on GitHub.

Enough of the intro, let's get down to business.  I wanted to share in this post what I learned as a software developer in the last almost 5 years and anything else I want to learn further moving forward.  I will not go into details on each one of them as I want to keep this post from getting too long.  Just going to list them out for now.

As far as back end technologies goes, here is a list of things I learned:
* [Servicestack](https://servicestack.net/) on C# .NET Framework for creating RESTful APIs for the front end to call (before ASP.Net MVC API and ASP.Net Core were available)
* [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) (came with Servicestack) for viewing those APIs and trying them out in a browser
* [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/): EC2, S3, Athena, CloudFront, CloudWatch, Elasticsearch,  RDS, SES, SNS, SQS, CloudFormation, IAM, Lambda, Management Console, Systems Manager - App Management
* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/): BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions, Cloud Scheduler, IAM,
* 3rd Party API Integrations: [Lever](https://www.lever.co/), [Smartsheet](https://www.smartsheet.com/), [ServiceDeskPlus](https://www.manageengine.com/products/service-desk/), [Slack](https://slack.com/) 
* Databases: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) / [MongoDB C#/.NET Driver](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/csharp/)
* [NUnit](https://nunit.org/) for unit-testing .NET code
* Others: [Puppeteer](https://www.puppeteersharp.com/) for scraping LinkedIn profiles, [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) (here is the [reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html)), [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/index.html)

And for front end technologies:
* [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org/) a not so new Javascript framework for building single page applications in MVC style
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for coding with type checking in Javascript
* [Lit](https://lit.dev/) a library for building fast, lightweight [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)
* [Vaadin Router](https://vaadin.com/router) for client-side routing of web components
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for managing state in Javascript applications
* [Carbon Web Components](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-web-components) a variant of [Carbon Design System](https://carbondesignsystem.com/) implemented as web components
* [StoryBook](https://storybook.js.org/) for documenting UI components but also for developing and testing UI components in isolation

What I would look to try or learn next are:
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) (just one of them for now).  Maybe create a to do list app which will be a part of like a mail or calendar app similar to Google Mail or Google Calendar.
* [Angular](https://angular.io/). Actually continue learning it (it's a big framework btw) by building more features on this Angular project I worked on last time, the product catalog, to maybe make it more like an Amazon online store, right?.
* [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core?view=aspnetcore-6.0). Probably only for it's [Web API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/?view=aspnetcore-6.0) and [SignalR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/introduction?view=aspnetcore-6.0).  I'm still interested with ASP.Net Core.  I'm thinking of getting a free [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/) account to play with these and maybe try out the other free stuff there.
* [Phython](https://www.python.org/) / [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning).  Yes machine learning has been in my radar for a while now.  It's a pretty big scope and it's very technical if I may say.  There are so many stuff out there being put out with how to make machines learn.  I'm interested in using Phython for this.  I recently read about this article 
[Top 100 Machine Learning Project Ideas for Tech Enthusiasts](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-100-machine-learning-project-ideas-for-tech-enthusiasts/) and it can definitely be a source of motivation.
* Metaverse Application Development.  Technologies surrounding this really piqued my interest.  I'm hoping they would be useful outside of social networking, like maybe in the medical fields or somewhere else.  This article [The Skills You Need To Become a Metaverse Developer](https://simpleprogrammer.com/skills-metaverse-developer/) lists out those technologies.
* Blockchain Application Development.  I'm interested on blockchain technologies for non-financial applications though.  This article 
[A Complete Roadmap to Blockchain Development](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/the-complete-roadmap-to-blockchain-development/) will serve as an introduction and guide.

Now we've come to the end of this post.  Writing a blog really takes time, for me at least.  I would prefer to spend it coding on my projects than blogging. But I will make it to a point to put one every month.  So that's it, all 5 years worth in one post, well just in summary.
