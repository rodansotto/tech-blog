Even though I'm still using VS2013 for all the projects I'm working on, it won't hurt to know the new features of C# 6 in VS2015.  I might start converting some of them or maybe start the new projects in VS2015, who knows.

I won't try to write about the new features in C# 6 in this post as I am pretty sure you can find them on the Internet.  Though there is one that I like and it's [New Language Features in C# 6](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/wiki/New-Language-Features-in-C%23-6).  I hope this helps.

**EDIT:**

Microsoft Docs has a [What's new in C# 6](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-6) article which I think is where the above article is based on.  Also check out their [The history of C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-version-history) article to refresh yourself on the features added to previous versions of C#.  There is now also [What's new in C# 7.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-7) and [What's new in C# 7.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-7-1).
