I’m excited to start in my new job next week.  I can’t wait.  Now that everything seems to be going back to normal (hopefully it stays that way), I plan on getting back on track to certify myself on .NET.  I browsed the Microsoft certification website and it seems getting certified with .NET Framework Foundation is a good bet.  Not only it applies to .NET 2.0 but to .NET 3.5 as well.  Again this blog will serve as my notes as I study for this certification.  Wish me luck!
