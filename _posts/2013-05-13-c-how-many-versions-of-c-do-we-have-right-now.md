The latest version of **C#** that came with **Visual Studio 2012** and **.NET Framework 4.5** is **5.0**.  For those who are still working on **.NET Framework 2.0**, the version of C# you are using is **2.0**.  Between these, you have **3.0** and **4.0**.  So naturally you might ask what are the differences between these versions?  Don’t fear, help is here ;).  Fortunately, there are some information on the Internet that can provide you with these differences and in more detail than I can possibly explain here in my post.  Below are the links you can go to.  Enjoy!
