[Access](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/access/FX100487571033.aspx) is the first database that I worked on, not SQL Server.  I started with version 97.  Now with version 2007 available, you ask why master 2003 when there is already 2007.  For one it's still relatively new and companies especially small to mid-size ones where I cater to most, don't jump hastily to new technologies so there should be plenty of pre-2007 Access applications around to work on.  My purpose in this journey is to eventually get certified with Access 2003 so wish me luck.
