Now that I have a public website with my own domain name, I decided to publish by web pages that demonstrate the new HTML5 and CSS3 features.Â  I will regularly update this post with links to my web pages.

HTML5:

- Form Input Types
- Canvas (and WebGL)
- SVG
- Video and Audio
- Geolocation
- Drag/Drop
- Web Storage
- Application Cache
- Web Workers
- SSE (and WebSockets)

CSS3:

- Borders, Backgrounds, Gradients, Text Effects, and Fonts (Web Fonts)
- 2D and 3D Transforms
- Transitions
- Animations
- Multiple Columns
- Flexi Box Model
- User Interface
