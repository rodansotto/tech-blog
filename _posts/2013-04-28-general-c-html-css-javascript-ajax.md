My previous job requires me to work on **C#**, and occasionally on **HTML**, **CSS**, **Javascript**, and **AJAX**.  To be honest, I like C# more than VB.NET, being a C programmer for a while way back starting from University days and was very good at it.  So I created a **C#** category on my blog because I plan on keeping my C# skills and improving on it.  I also created a **Web UI** category where I can put all my notes about HTML, CSS, Javascript, AJAX, and more.  I don't use these skills much but since I wanted to work more on the front end of web development for some time now, I plan to keep these skills up to date and what better way to do this is to make use of the W3Schools site.  So I added a link to the website under **Favorite Links**.  I am so excited about these technologies that I can't wait to be blogging more often.  Happy blogging!
