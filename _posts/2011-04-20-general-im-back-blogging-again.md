These past 2 years have been busy for me, with a new job and a new baby in 2009.  Unfortunately I left my job to take a family-related sabbatical for 8 months.   Now I am looking for another job and blogging again.

Since my last blog on the following technologies: .NET Framework 2.0 and briefly on [3.5](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb332048.aspx) (should probably look at [3.0](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb822048.aspx) first), Visual Basic 2005, SQL Server 2005, and ASP.NET 2.0, newer versions have appeared.  We now have [.NET Framework 4.0](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms171868.aspx), [Visual Basic 2010](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/we86c8x2.aspx) (previous to that [Visual Basic 2008](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y17w47af(v=vs.90).aspx)), [SQL Server 2008](http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2008/en/us/whats-new.aspx) and [ASP.NET 4.0](http://www.asp.net/learn/whitepapers/aspnet4) (previous to that [ASP.NET 3.5](http://www.asp.net/downloads/vs2008) and [3.0](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fa1h9d0d(v=vs.85).aspx)).

I will try to touch briefly on these new versions and take a look what is new there while still focusing on the older versions.

I also plan on putting up a portfolio of my work that I did as an independent contractor, showcasing my work on desktop, web, and mobile applications.
