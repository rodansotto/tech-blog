I created this section so I can take down some notes and be able to go back to them as I learn more about _HTML_, _CSS_, _Javascript_, and _AJAX_, especially now that there is a new version of _HTML 5_ and _CSS 3_.  I have used them occasionally at my previous jobs but I feel I need to brush up on them and widen my knowledge.  Plus, I also want to learn other technologies out there like _jQuery_, etc.  To help me achieve this, I will mostly be referring to W3Schools tutorials.  I have added a link to their site under the _Favorites Links_.  So, let’s see how this goes and wish me luck.
