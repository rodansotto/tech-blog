![](/technical-blog/assets/images/netbloglogo.png)Basically .NET Framework is an implementation of .NET, much like [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) if you know Mono.  .NET Core is a newer implementation of .NET that is dubbed as cross-platform and designed for cloud.  Now .NET Standard is what is common among these .NET implementations and if your .NET app targets .NET Standard, it would mean that it can run on any .NET implementations.  That is all there is to it.  See [Target frameworks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/frameworks)
