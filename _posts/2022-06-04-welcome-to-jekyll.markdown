I just migrated my technical blog from WordPress to
Jekyll on GitHub Pages.  And here's how I did it:

1. Exported my blog site in WordPress to XML.  See <https://wordpress.com/support/export/>.
2. Used [wordpress-export-to-markdown](https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown) to convert Wordpress export XML file into Markdown files suitable for Jekyll.
3. Created GitHub Pages site with Jekyll.  Found this [site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) really helpful.
4. Installed a different theme other than the default one that came with Jekyll.  I'm using [jeffreytse/jekyll-theme-yat](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-theme-yat).
