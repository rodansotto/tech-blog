**Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)** seems to be the successor to **Windows Forms** for desktop development.  The following are some of the highlights in WPF:

- Separation of logic code from the presentation code where the presentation code is defined using a declarative syntax called **Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML)**.
- Three kinds of application available for creation: **Windows applications**, **Navigation applications**, and **XAML Browser Applications (XBAPs)**.  **Windows applications** are similar to Windows Forms applications.  **Navigation applications** are similar to web sites in that they provide a page-based user experience but they run on the desktop computer like Windows applications.  **XBAPs** are similar to Navigation applications except that they run in Windows Internet Explorer.
- Unprecedented support for displaying **graphics**, **images**, and **media files**.
- **Binding** of a property to any object or source.  Use of **data templates** to configure how your data is displayed in the presentation layer.
- Use of **Styles**, **Animations**, and **Triggers** to provide consistent user interface appearance, add interactivity, and change the user interface appearance in response to different conditions.
- New document and printing model where you can work with **XML Paper Standard (XPS) Documents** and **Flow Documents**.
