This past year and a half gave me new skills from my last project.  I learned **Regular Expression**, **XSLT**, **XPath**, **Java**, **Eclipse**, and **C#**. 

In the next few weeks or months I will be making some changes on this blog.  I will be refocusing my effort now on **C#** instead of **VB.NET**.  It would be best for me to use **C#** as my main language so I can easily switch between **Java** and also since I started with **C** way back. 

You see **Java** does not seem to be far away from **C#** and in my last project I was able to pick up **Java** relatively easy.  But I am not saying I will abandon **VB.NET**, its just that I would prefer using **C#** over **VB.NET**. 

Below are links to some cheat sheets that I found that will help me retain my knowledge in **Java** and **VB.NET** as I immerse myself in **C#**:
