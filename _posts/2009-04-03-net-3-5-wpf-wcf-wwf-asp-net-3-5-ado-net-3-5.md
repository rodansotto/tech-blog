Now that .NET 3.5 is already out and I still have to get my certification on that .NET 2.0 Framework – Application Development Foundation, I decided to start ahead on learning these new technologies and not get left behind. 

The .NET Framework foundation is still important so I will still be continuing on that one except that I will start writing on .NET 3.5 in parallel.  I will probably start out with just a quick look at WPF, WCF, WWF, ASP.NET 3.5, and ADO.NET 3.5 just to get my feet wet.
